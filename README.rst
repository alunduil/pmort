Description
-----------

A simple local post-mortem analysis logger.  Saves pertinent information for
after-the-fact troubleshooting.

I would recommend using an actual remote logging and analysis service rather
than this crude utility but in a pinch this utility may get the information
needed to find the root of an issue.

Installation
------------

.. code-block::
    $python setup.py install
